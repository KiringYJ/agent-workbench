# Prompting and Agent Execution

This module keeps reusable prompts outcome-oriented and compatible with capable agentic models. It follows the current [OpenAI GPT-5.6 model guidance](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/model-guidance?model=gpt-5.6) while keeping the workbench vendor-neutral; model-specific request settings belong in vendor configuration, not in canonical project prompts.

## Prompt Contract

For a non-trivial task, make these elements explicit when they are not already established by project context:

- **Outcome**: the concrete result the user should receive.
- **Context**: the files, systems, facts, and prior decisions that matter.
- **Constraints**: hard requirements, preservation rules, and action boundaries.
- **Evidence**: the checks, citations, measurements, or artifacts needed to support the result.
- **Success criteria**: observable conditions that make the task complete.
- **Output**: the required format, structure, and level of detail.
- **Ambiguity gate**: the missing information that should trigger a question because guessing would materially change the result or risk.

Prefer decision criteria over a prescribed step-by-step script when several valid implementations exist. Preserve user-provided values and established project conventions.

## Keep Prompts Lean

- State each instruction once and keep the authoritative rule at the narrowest durable scope.
- Remove repeated reminders, generic encouragement, and examples that do not encode a requirement or repair a measured failure.
- Keep tool descriptions concise and expose only tools relevant to the task.
- Put stable context before changing request-specific context when the platform can reuse prompt prefixes.
- Change one prompt concern at a time and compare representative tasks before treating the revision as an improvement.

Do not repeat the full autonomy, safety, or verification policy inside every workflow prompt. Refer to the canonical guide and add only workflow-specific boundaries.

## Tool Routing

Use the single action policy in `Security and Safety`; workflow prompts should add only narrower exceptions or approval gates.

When a task can use multiple tools or execution routes, specify the stage, eligible tools, expected result shape, required evidence, retry limit, and stopping condition. Keep adaptive judgment, approvals, citation preservation, and final validation on a direct path. Do not select a batched or programmatic route merely because it is available.

## Response and Completion

- Lead with the outcome. Preserve required facts, decisions, evidence, caveats, and next actions before trimming secondary detail.
- Describe tone through concrete writing choices rather than broad labels.
- Use project or model configuration for a default verbosity when supported; use the task prompt for required content and structure.
- Define the stopping condition. If it cannot be met, return the strongest supported result, the exact gap, and the smallest useful next step.
- Do not count fewer tool calls, fewer tokens, or shorter output as an improvement unless the final result still passes the relevant quality checks.

Reasoning effort, pro modes, caching, and other vendor-specific capabilities are evaluation and configuration decisions. Do not replace a clear outcome, evidence standard, or validation loop with instructions to “think harder.”
